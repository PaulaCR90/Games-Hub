Here is my latest project!
I'm so proud to be able to do this by now. Probably the most exciting project till today.

**You will have a longin page, where you can log with the nickname you want, but de PASSWORD must be "Luigi". If it's not, you won't be able to continue.**

**Then, it will appear a home page for you to choose the game you want to play.**

**The first game is Tictactoe, where player X is now a ðŸ’© and player O is represented by a ðŸ‘».**
Hopefully fun. For two players.

**The second game is Hangman. Where you will have to know the word (all of them in Spanish) with 6 possible errors max.**

**The third, and the most exciting for me to create, has been the Sudoku**
You have all the time you need. 
Click on de numbers down the 9x9 grid.
Then, the same numbers will appear in the grid to help you know where to put the missing ones.

THAT'S ALL!
I hope you enjoy it.

Feedback is allways welcome.
